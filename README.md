# DQN_Frozenlake_Reinforcement_Learning
This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent in the Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI's GYM. The aim is to train the RL agent to navigate the frozen lake and reach the goal without falling into holes.
